# Scooped Game
Scooped is a game that takes a twist on the popular game Hangman. This game has a one player mode and a two player mode.

## Features
In the planning phase, I outlined a Bronze, Silver, and Gold version, with Bronze being the minimum viable product. Currently, the game includes some but not all of the elements from the Gold version.

Bronze: 
Player 1 should be able to select a word for player 2 to guess. For each incorrect guess, a component of the ice cream should disappear. Player 1 wins if player 2 loses all of their icecream, and player 2 wins if they guess the word before all of their ice cream is lost. In any case, the word should be revealed at the end of the game.

Silver: 
Adding a clue feature, for player 1 to to provide a clue for player 2. 

Gold: 
Building out a one player mode. A random word should be generated for the player. A corresponding clue should also be provided.

Adding a modal for the instructions. 

Adding alerts for invalid inputs.

Adding a rematch feature to track scores over multiple games.

### Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Bootstrap components

#### Instructions:
Scooped has a one player mode and a two player mode. 

In the one player mode, the user must guess a word that is chosen at random. A clue is provided,and the user has 7 chances to guess the word correctly. Each incorrect guess leads to losing a topping or scoop of ice cream. The objective of the game is to guess the word correctly before all of the ice cream is lost. 

In the two player mode, player 1 chooses a word for player 2 to guess. Player 1 also provides player 2 with a clue. Player 2 has 7 chances to guess the word, losing a topping for every incorrect guess.
